The rationale for developing OpenMx is discussed along with the philosophy behind the user interface. The OpenMx data structures are introduced\textemdash these novel structures define the user interface framework and provide new opportunities for model specification. Two short example scripts for the specification and fitting of a confirmatory factor model are next presented. We end with an abbreviated list of modeling applications available in OpenMx 1.0 and a discussion of directions for future development.},

  abstract = {Assessing measurement invariance is an important step in establishing a meaningful comparison of measurements of a latent construct across individuals or groups. Most recently, moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) has been proposed as a method to assess measurement invariance. In MNLFA models, measurement invariance is examined in a single-group confirmatory factor analysis model by means of parameter moderation. The advantages of MNLFA over other methods is that it (a) accommodates the assessment of measurement invariance across multiple continuous and categorical background variables and (b) accounts for heteroskedasticity by allowing the factor and residual variances to differ as a function of the background variables. In this article, we aim to make MNLFA more accessible to researchers without access to commercial structural equation modeling software by demonstrating how this method can be applied with the open-source R package OpenMx.},

First, we present an R package mokken for MSA and explain the procedures. Second, we show how to perform MSA in R using test data obtained with the Adjective Checklist.},

Over the years, many software packages for structural equation modeling have been developed, both free and commercial. However, perhaps the best state-of-the-art software packages in this field are still closedsource and/or commercial. The R package lavaan has been developed to provide applied researchers, teachers, and statisticians, a free, fully open-source, but commercial-quality package for latent variable modeling. This paper explains the aims behind the development of the package, gives an overview of its most important features, and provides some examples to illustrate how lavaan works in practice.},
